# aws-quicksight-pipeline-with-terraform-lambda
 I've developed a data pipeline on AWS that uses Terraform to automate resource deployment, incorporating Lambda functions and SNS notifications to manage the data flow. The pipeline begins with the upload of JSON files into S3 storage buckets. A Lambda function is triggered to process the file, extract key-value pairs, and convert the data into a CSV file.  The CSV file is then sent to AWS QuickSight for visualization. Once the visualization is ready, an SNS notification is triggered to indicate that the report has been generated. I used Terraform to create and configure the S3 buckets, Lambda functions, SNS topics, and to automate the entire data pipeline. This project also includes Python scripts for data processing, as well as documentation detailing the pipeline's workflow and the steps required to deploy it with Terraform.
